# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-11-03

Changes since 0.1.0:

- Windows centered window groups retain each member's focused size, shrink and stagger inactive members, and restore members on mouse or Alt+Tab focus.
- H/L rotates through centered groups. Hold either horizontal focus shortcut for 400 ms to enter middle windows from an edge-snapped window or return to background edge windows. J/K exits groups vertically.
- Regular directional navigation targets edge-snapped windows by default, including covered windows. Middle-window navigation and its visibility filter are separately configurable and default to off.
- Configurable Windows focus glow highlights successful positioning and focus changes. Fixed the settings color picker crash and confirmed activation before highlighting.
- New configurations default to three 15% growth steps. Saved growth values remain unchanged. Percentage controls now live under the collapsed Advanced settings section.
- Removed the redundant Close settings button; use the window close control to leave the tray running.
- Documentation includes updated navigation and settings guidance, an animated hero, a playable promo thumbnail, and social sharing previews.
- Fixed Linux/macOS compilation of shortcut handling by gating the Windows foreground-window lookup.
- Windows file and product versions now derive from Cargo, alongside CLI version reporting; packaging rejects version mismatches.

The new grouping, directional focus, and glow behavior is Windows-only. Hold shortcuts and continuous mouse/Alt+Tab group observation require the tray app.

## 0.1.0

Initial release with native window positioning, configurable shortcuts, anchored growth, width adjustment, gap filling, Windows shared-boundary resizing and directional focus, and release packages for Windows x64, Linux x64, and macOS Apple Silicon.
